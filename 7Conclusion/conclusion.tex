\chapter{CONCLUSION}
Voice Emotion Analyzer system had successfully demonstrated a viable multi-dataset emotion detection framework, having achieved 85.21\% training accuracy, 83.80\% validation accuracy, 83.89\% test accuracy, and consistent cross-dataset generalization performance, thereby validating the multi-source training methodology combining RAVDESS, TESS, SAVEE, and custom datasets while revealing clear scope for natural emotion integration, cross-lingual adaptation, and real-world deployment optimization.
