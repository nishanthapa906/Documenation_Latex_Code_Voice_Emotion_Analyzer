I would wish to thank the greatest of the great who contributed and supported this project and made it possible.
I would like to show my utmost appreciation towards my supervisor, \textbf{\thesupervisor}, of \textbf{Citizen College}. Their precious advices, constructive criticisms, and support were essential in ensuring the completion of this work was successful. They influenced the course of my research and the quality of its results, based on their knowledge and positive advice. Moreover, they were the BCA Coordinator, and their thorough coordination and unambiguous decisive feedback made this entire project process much higher.
My friends and fellow colleagues are also people I am grateful to. Their liberal advice, encouragement, and companionship during this time made the whole hard journey not only pleasant, but also rewarding in the end.
And lastly, I would not be able to thank my family enough. It is my parents who, especially, inculcated in me unshaken faith and gave me a source of deep inspiration. It is because their consistent encouragement and constant emotional support became the invaluable base with the help of which I could attain my objectives.
